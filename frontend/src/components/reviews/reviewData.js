        description: "There are thousands of practice problems out there, but AlgoExpert provides curation, in-depth explanation, code testing, and support for multiple programming languages. A lot of the problems even have multiple solutions. I'm very glad I invested in it, and even though I've already been hired, I'm still using it to keep my skills up."

        description: "Hey, just wanted to thank you for AlgoExpert! I signed up a few months back and I went through 60% of the problems. Before AlgoExpert I was awful at solving anything harder than a LeetCode easy, now I can do LeetCode mediums without much effort and tackle LeetCode hards in a reasonable time frame! I donâ€™t think I would have gotten an internship without AlgoExpert, so thank you!"

        description: "I just got a job offer from Oracle and most of the questions they asked, I had practiced on AlgoExpert. Even when they asked questions I was not familiar with, I was able to break down the problem and write code which I learned from the explanations section on AlgoExpert. Being a Computer Science Engineering student, I had fundamental knowledge in Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, but I didn't know how to approach, break down and apply this knowledge to solve problems. Also since all the problems are classified into categories, I was able to easily identify my weak points and work on those. Extremely grateful to AlgoExpert !"
